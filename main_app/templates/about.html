    <h2>Why Reflections</h2>
    <p>Life is full of moments worth remembering. Often those moments only exist as a thought when they are suddenly remembered. The purpose of reflections is to provide a place to store those moments when they happen, a place to reflect on those moments, and a place to share them with others.</p>
