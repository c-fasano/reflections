## What is this app for 

Reflections is an application where users can document and store significant moments of their lives. 

Though the central theme of Reflections is documenting moments of one's life, it is different from a typical daily journal in that Reflections is organized by moments or events. Each moment or event has a date attached to it but whether that date was yesterday or 5 years in the past, user's can easily access their original documentation and further it.

## How did this app come to be
There were numerous factors that contributed to the development of Reflections. 

- I have often found myself guilty of overlooking successes, accomplishments or progress and winding up focused on should'ves, would'ves, and could'ves as well as the next task at hand. 
- I heard a speech, ["This is Water" -David Foster Wallace,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI) just before developing this application that I had heard roughly 7 years ago which had a significant impact on me. This made me think to myself about how powerful it would be to have a place to see my thoughts from 7 years ago and furthermore to build upon those thoughts with those from the present. The title of this speech also largely played into the theming and design of the website. 
- There is no greater way to see ones own growth than to reflect on where they were at some point in the past.
